#Project Webfolio
#This is a school project that requires me to develop a website that showcases what projects I have done and an introduction. 
#I want to make the first sight to be such that when the user clicks onto the website, it shows a self introduction. 
#After the user scrolls down, I want the cards that represent the projects to move in with a closewise motion from the back of the screen to the front of the screen.
#After the card gets onto the screen, the amount of projects is the amount of cards that appear, for now since I only have 1 project, there will be 3 cards with 2 as a placemaker.
#Then after the cards appear onto the screen, the text that appears on the card on the screen is the projects, with one project occupying one card.
#After clicking onto the card, the user will be redirected to a page with the project.
